# Emoji Copy Clipboard — Chrome Extension

**Author:** Lily Del Pilar  
**Published Chrome Extension**

## Overview

Emoji Copy Clipboard is a simple and practical Chrome extension designed to help users quickly insert emojis or custom meme-like images into messages, emails, or documents—even on platforms that lack native emoji support.

I developed this project to solve a personal problem: I frequently wanted to add emojis or memes while communicating online, but switching tabs or searching through folders was disruptive. This tool offers a compact, accessible solution right from the browser toolbar.

## Features

- **Unicode Emoji Picker**  
  Browse from a preset library of common emojis. Click to instantly copy the emoji to your clipboard.

- **Custom Image Uploads**  
  Upload your own meme-style emojis or stickers. Thumbnails appear visually in the extension. One click copies the image for pasting anywhere.

- **Private Storage**  
  All uploads are saved locally via Chrome’s storage API—no cloud storage or external servers involved.

## Why I Built It

This project combines creativity with technical utility. As someone interested in UI design and accessible tools, I wanted to explore Chrome’s extension APIs and build a tool that is both fun and user-oriented. I also funded and published the extension to learn the full deployment process and to showcase it as a portfolio piece.
